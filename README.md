# smMIPS MRD for LSC project

This repository describes the workflow for analysing MRD samples sequenced using smMIPS assay.  
.  

## Usage
The following parameters need to be modified in the `params` section of the `nextflow.config` : 
- *genome* = Complete path to the human genome fasta file(hg19_all.fasta). Please ensure that the BWA index files (hg19_all.fasta.fai, hg19_all.fasta.amb, hg19_all.fasta.ann, hg19_all.fasta.bwt, hg19_all.fasta.pac, hg19_all.fasta.sa) are also present in the same genome folder. The assests folder currently contains placeholder genome and index files.

- *annovar_db* = Complete path to the humandb database folder for ANNOVAR (refer https://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/user-guide/startup/ )

- *bedfile* = This file needs to be updated based on the probes used for the assay

- *outdir* = Location to write the output folder

## Running the pipeline
1. Transfer the sample input files `*.fastq.gz` inside the `sequences/` folder.

2. Modify the `samplesheet.csv`. The sample_ids, without the file extension, should be mentioned in samplesheet in the following format - <br>
sample1  
sample2  
sample3  
Please check for empty lines in the samplesheet before running the pipeline.

3. To execute the pipeline, use the following command
```bash
nextflow -C mrd_capture.config run mrd_capture.nf -entry MRD_PROBE -bg -profile docker -resume
```

## Output
Samplewise output folders are written to `Final_output/` folder.
