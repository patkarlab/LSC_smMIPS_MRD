# smMIPS MRD workflow description

This repository describes the workflow for analysing MRD samples sequenced using smMIPS assay. Detailed steps to generate the site and mutation specific error model are mentioned in error_model.md file

## Usage
The following parameters need to be modified in the `params` section of the `nextflow.config` before executing the workflow : 
- *genome* = Complete path to the human genome fasta file(hg19_all.fasta). Please ensure that the BWA index files (hg19_all.fasta.fai, hg19_all.fasta.amb, hg19_all.fasta.ann, hg19_all.fasta.bwt, hg19_all.fasta.pac, hg19_all.fasta.sa) are also present in the same genome folder. The assests folder currently contains placeholder genome and index files.

- *annovar_humandb* = Complete path to the humandb database folder for [ANNOVAR](https://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/user-guide/startup/ "annovar site")

- *gen_ref*	= Complete path to the gene_fullxref.txt file as downloaded from the [ANNOVAR](https://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/user-guide/startup/ "annovar site") site

- *bedfile* = This file needs to be updated based on the probes used for the assay

- *outdir* = Location to write the output folder

## Running the pipeline
1. Transfer the sample input files `*.fastq.gz` inside the `sequences/` folder.

2. Modify the `samplesheet.csv`. The sample_ids, without the file extension, should be mentioned in samplesheet in the following format - <br>
sample1  
sample2  
sample3  
Please check for empty lines in the samplesheet before running the pipeline.

3. To execute the pipeline, use the following command
```bash
nextflow -C nextflow.config run sal_mips.nf -entry MIPS -bg -profile docker -resume
```

## Output
Samplewise output folders are written to the folder name mentioned in the `outdir` param in the config file.
